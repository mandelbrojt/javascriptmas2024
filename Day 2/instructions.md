# Instructions

## Basic Goals
Improve the user interface of the calendar by adding or modifying styles for better:
- White space
- Color
- Contrast
- Scale
- Alignment
- Typography
- Visual hierarchy

## Stretch Goals
1. Make the calendar more interactive; clicking each day could "open" that day.
2. Every day that is open displays a random Christmas gift (or chocolate?) in the box.
3. Save the state of the calendar in `LocalStorage`.
