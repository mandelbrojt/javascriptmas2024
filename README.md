> Challenges from Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2024 edition  

From December 1st to December 24th, a new coding challenge will be released each day.  

For every solved challenge, participants can submit their solutions and share them on X, LinkedIn, TikTok, or Instagram to enter for a chance to win the Grand Prize.  

> **Note:** Be sure to include the `#JavaScriptmas` hashtag when sharing on social media. This is required to be eligible for the prize draw.  

### **Grand Prize**  
All valid solutions will be entered into our Grand Prize drawing on December 25th. Two entries will be randomly selected to each win:  
- A 13" MacBook Air M3  
- Merchandise from MDN and Scrimba  
- A lifetime Scrimba Pro membership  

### **Terms and Conditions**  
- Every submission, whether made on the platform or via social media, provides one entry into the prize draw.  
- The more challenges you complete, the higher your chances of winning.  
- All solutions must be submitted by the deadline: **midnight, Christmas Eve**.  

After the event concludes, we will randomly select two winners: one from platform submissions and one from social media submissions.  

> **Important:** Submissions will not be judged based on quality. As long as you solve the challenge, youâ€™re eligible to win. However, we will audit the winners to ensure their submissions represent genuine effort. Spam, AI-generated solutions, or low-effort entries will not qualify for the prize.
